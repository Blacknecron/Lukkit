# Lukkit
Lukkit is a Bukkit plugin that allows you to write your own Bukkit plugins in Lua.

## Documentation
Due to lack of planning and so forth, documentation may not be fully up to scratch for versions 2.1.0 and below. v3 will be fully documented as the plugin gets rewritten.

The documentation can be found on [here](https://docs.lukkit.net)

## Development
If you want to help out you can reach out to us on Discord (see below), submit a PR/issue or talk to us wherever. Your opinion could really help.

We have 3 main branches at the moment.
* ``master`` is the latest release (2.1.0) and will not be touched directly.
* ``dev`` is the latest release + patches if need be. Any changes that need releasing pre-v3 will be merged into ``master``.
* ``v3-dev`` contains the currently indev source for Lukkit v3. Once the build is somewhat stable it will be merged into ``dev`` and subsequently ``master``.

Alongside those branches, we also have a system for updates.
* ``dev`` is for direct updates that could be small
* ``dev-FEATURE`` is used when you want to introduce something into ``dev`` without messing with the current source. Fork ``dev`` from the latest commit, make your changes then merge back into dev after discussion.

Note that these branches only matter the developers that are part of the Lukkit organisation.
